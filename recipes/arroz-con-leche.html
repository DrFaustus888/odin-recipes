        <li>1 cup short grain rice</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>powdered cinnamon to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 can sweetened condensed milk</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk together the cans of condensed and evaporated milk and add the vanilla. Put in fridge.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, mix the water, rice, a couple shakes of cinnamon, and the salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the rice is tender and the water is mostly absorbed.</li>
        <li>When the rice is done, stir in the milk mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook uncovered over medium low heat. Keep stirring so that it doesn't stick. </li>
        <li>Once the pudding is thick and you can see the grains of rice, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Put the pudding into a bowl, sprinkle it with cinnamon and chill in the fridge for at least one hour.</li>
